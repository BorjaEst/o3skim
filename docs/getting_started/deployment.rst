Deployment
==================================

To deploy the the application using **udocker** at the **Runtime machine** 
you need the o3skim container image.

The easiest way to deploy in your **Runtime machine**  is by pulling the image
from a remote registry. You can use the official registry at synergyimk_ or use 
the instructions at :doc:`build` to create your image and uploaded at your own registry.

.. _synergyimk: https://hub.docker.com/r/synergyim

Once you decide from which registry download, pull the image that image registry.
For example, to pull it from the synergy-imk official registry use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ udocker pull synergyimk/o3skim
    ...
    Downloading layer: sha256:......
    ...

Note it is also possible to use `udocker load`_ to import images generated by 
`docker save`_.

.. _`udocker load`: https://indigo-dc.gitbook.io/udocker/user_manual#1-4-basic-flow
.. _`docker save`: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save


Once the image is downloaded or imported, create the local container.
For example, if it was downloaded from synergyimk registry you can use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ udocker create --name=o3skim synergyimk/o3skim
    fa42a912-b0d4-3bfb-987f-1c243863802d

Check the containers 
available at the **Runtime machine**: 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ udocker ps
    CONTAINER ID                         P M NAMES              IMAGE               
    ...
    fa42a912-b0d4-3bfb-987f-1c243863802d . W ['o3skim']         synergyimk/o3skim:latest


Now you are ready to start using the container as `o3skim`. Read how to use the 
:doc:`cli` as first steps to skim your data.
